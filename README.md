# Bridging-language-and-Data-Intelligent-Query-Generation-using-LLaMA
This project implements an AI-powered SQL agent that allows users to query databases using plain English. The system leverages TinyLLaMA (or DialoGPT as a fallback) with LangChain to generate SQL queries from natural language inputs and visualizes the results, making data more accessible for non-technical users.
